Experiment child theme for [Twenty Twenty-Two]().

## Description

This child theme was an experiment just to see if `theme.json` would override a block-based theme's `theme.json` the same way as any other file in a child theme would without any other changes or additional development. Turns out it works pretty well, you can head over to my [`theme.json`](https://github.com/jazzsequence/jz-222/blob/main/theme.json) file to see what's been changed.
