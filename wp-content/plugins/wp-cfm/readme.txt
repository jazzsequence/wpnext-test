Manage and deploy WordPress configuration changes.

== Description ==

WP-CFM lets you copy database configuration to / from the filesystem. Easily deploy configuration changes without needing to copy the entire database. WP-CFM is similar to Drupal's Features module.

= How will WP-CFM benefit me? =

* Less need to copy over the entire database.
* No more rushing to figure out which settings you forgot to change.
* Easily track and version configuration changes via git, subversion, etc.

= Which data does WP-CFM support? =

* WP settings (`wp_options` table)
* Multisite settings (`wp_sitemeta` table)
* Taxonomy terms
* Custom Field Suite field groups

= Terminology =

* Bundle - A group of (one or more) settings to track
* Push - Export database settings to the filesystem
* Pull - Import file-based settings into the database

= WP-CLI =

WP-CFM supports [pull / push / diff] of bundles from the command-line using [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/):

<pre>
wp config pull [bundle_name]
wp config push [bundle_name]
wp config diff [bundle_name]
wp config bundles
wp config show_bundle [bundle_name]
</pre>

You can optionally set `bundle_name` to "all" to include all bundles.

Append the `--network` flag to include multisite bundles.
