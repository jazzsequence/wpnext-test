# WordPress 6.2 Tester plugin

Tests some new features of WP 6.2.

## Currently testing

### `move_dir`

An admin page is created with buttons that attempt to use the new `move_dir` command. The assumption is that you are working on an immutable filesystem, so some instances of `move_dir` will be impossible due to file write permissions. The actions will fire regardless and work successfully on systems with full read/write access (e.g. localdev) but the descriptions indicate the expected behavior.

### `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor`

An admin page is created that simply renders some html and inserts other HTML using the new `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor` class. 

## Uses

* [CMB2/CMB2](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2) - For an easy-to-bootstrap admin page. Creates a custom field type for the buttons.

## Warnings

This file is not recommended for any kind of production use. There are no nonces and we're moving stuff around the filesystem. Use at your own peril. ðŸ˜…

There's not a lot of inline comments. This was done primarily for speed. The code should be pretty self-explanatory, but it's entirely possible that it makes sense to me but not as much to someone else. Sorry not sorry. `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`
